Java Project Semester 2 Year 2

Firstly,
Hope you enjoy my java project as I spent alot 
of time and effort on it and I see it as a fun
project for the future.

I also want to say I tried my best to keep the video short
but there was no way I could explain all my code
In a short amount of time. 

I started by using this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzhgsVaiSo
and went on to make my own game

I created all the sprites and music on my own

I also tried to make a jar file but 
it wont run the music (I still included it)#

Let me know if there are any changes needed
